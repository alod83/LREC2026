As happy as...,"Regular readers of this mailing list will know that it has often featured 'as x as y' similes.

However this pattern breaks down when it comes to happiness. Larks and dogs with two tails fit the bill as creatures known to be happy but the three best-known 'happy' similes are 'as happy as a clam/a sandboy/Larry'.
